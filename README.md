 - No assets to relating the 'The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run' are to exist within this repo, 100% of this repo should only hold base Unity project files and script files relating to implementing features relating to the original game. Assets from the original game will be retrieved by pointing to the original files at runtime. Again, to run this you must have an original install of ‘The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run’ to use this software.

Anyone at all can help with the project, we want this to be a fun community effort of bringing back our favourite nostalgia-fest that can be accessed as easily as possible through the Unity platform. So come and join in!
